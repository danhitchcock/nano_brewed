Two taps, four beers, (soon...) one cryptocurrency.

NanoBrewed is a Python/Kivy Raspberry Pi touch app that accepts Nano cryptocurrency and dispenses beer (or kombucha) from a kegerator! Works best with fresh homebrew, of course.

## Why did you do this?
I moved and have been unemployed for 2 months.

## Why Nano?
Nano is feeless and nearly instant. It also doesn't have wallet minimums or minimum transactions, making payment processing a breeze.

## What are Chips and Stones?
Chips and Stones were my take on shifiting the decimal in Nano. Shift it 100x over, and we have a Stone, a reference to the RaiBlocks raistone origin. 1/1000th of a stone is a Chip, like a small piece of a stone chipped off.

In the program, we are transacting very small amounts of Nano (0.005 Nanos). If Nano reached a marketcap of $133B USD, a Nano would be worth $1,000 USD. In this case, a chip would be 1 US Cent, and a $5 beer would cost 500 Chips. No decimal needed, incredibly easy to work with.

## When will the commercial version be available?
It won't.

## How will this help Nano adoption?
It won't.
