# NanoBrewed

Two taps, four beers, one cryptcurrency.

NanoBrewed is a Python/Kivy Raspberry Pi touch app that accepts Nano cryptocurrency and dispenses beer (or kombucha) from a kegerator! Works best with fresh homebrew, of course.
## NanoBrewed is under contruction. Hopefully v0.1 will be ready December 1st, 2018.
